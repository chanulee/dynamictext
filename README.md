# Title
"I think that there are going to be profoundly interesting things that BCI can read out that people can't, let's say, communicate volitionally very easily right now." - Matt Angle, CEO of Paradromics

With emojis, we were able to communicate much more than just textual facts. Neurotechnology might provide a similar expansion of bandwidth in communication. Sending a message with your excitement and being able to express it could lead to less miscommunication, especially when tone is important. Furthermore, this doesn't stop at the level of 'replicating' real-world communication as we know it. It's a new horizon of human ability of self-expression and communication.
